                  My journey into naturopathic wellness began with a simple, profound realization: our bodies have an innate wisdom and a remarkable capacity to heal. The modern world often disconnects us from this wisdom, but through nature, we can find our way back.

                  At The Island Apothecary, my goal is to be your guide on this path. I blend traditional herbalism, evidence-based nutrition, and a deep respect for individual needs to create a wellness plan that feels authentic to you. It's not about quick fixes; it's about building a sustainable, joyful, and healthy lifestyle, one step at a time.
